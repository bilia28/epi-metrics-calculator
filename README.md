Python-based Epidemiology Metrics Calculator for Surveillance &amp; Outbreak Response
A Python-based console application designed to compute key epidemiological indicators used in surveillance and outbreak response.
Overview
This project automates the calculation of core public health metrics commonly used in WHO surveillance systems and outbreak investigations.
It demonstrates:
•	Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
•	Input validation
•	Error handling
•	Persistent logging
•	Mathematical modelling
•	Clean structured design
Metrics Implemented
•	Attack Rate (%)
•	Case Fatality Rate (CFR %)
•	Incidence Rate
•	Prevalence (%)
•	Doubling Time (Exponential growth)
Example Use Case
During outbreak response, surveillance officers must rapidly calculate:
•	Transmission intensity
•	Mortality risk
•	Growth trends
This tool provides a structured and reusable Python-based solution.
Installation
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/epi-metrics-calculator.git
cd epi-metrics-calculator
python epi_calculator.py
Professional Relevance
This project aligns with:
•	WHO surveillance operations
•	Data analyst roles in public health
•	AI-driven early warning systems
•	Certified Health Data Analyst (CHDA) competencies
Future Enhancements
•	CSV data ingestion
•	Visualization dashboard
•	Stream lit web app version
•	Predictive outbreak modelling
